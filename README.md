# Agents-with-domain-knowledge-

Recently, there have been many agents that mimic agile team members and other roles.
All of these agents are based on the simple concept of "You're a super expert in something,"
but they don't provide specific knowledge about the best practices for each role. 

This repository will store a catalog of agents with specific knowledge 
that can be used in Claude Code, Cursor, VSCode, Kilo code, Cline, Codex, and similar tools.
