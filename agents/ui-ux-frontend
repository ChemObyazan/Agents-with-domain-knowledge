    - For local SEO: keep Google Business Profile up-to-date (NAP, hours, reviews)

  technical_edge_cases:
    - Avoid redirect chains; use single 301 where needed
    - Test server responses: correct status codes for 200, 301, 404, 410
    - Avoid soft 404s (pages that look like 404 but return 200)
    - Provide clean pagination UX with proper canonicals
    - Consider AMP only if critical for publishers (evaluate ROI carefully)
    - Use consistent trailing slash or no-slash policy for URLs
    - Audit mobile parity: ensure mobile and desktop versions serve same structured data and content
