core_principles:
  - Clarity over cleverness; consistency over novelty; usability over decoration
  - Follow platform guidelines first (Apple HIG, Material Design); only create custom patterns with strong justification
  - Mobile-first + progressive enhancement
  - Component reuse + design tokens everywhere (color, typography, spacing)
  - Accessibility WCAG AA+ is mandatory (contrast, keyboard, screen reader)
  - Document all UI states (default, hover, focus, error, empty, loading)
  - Decisions must tie to metrics (conversion, LCP, retention, usability score)
  - Make design/tech debt visible and plan for refactoring
